# Reflection

This was a 4 week long project built for client-Hospital Organization as a Proof of Concepts(POC). Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I started to create this application by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.0 and axios as a service layer. Login Component, Navigation Bar, HomePage and table(Material-table ui) components were developed. At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Java and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup.

Spring boot Java Application was provided as a backend service. I implemented using DAO(Data Acess Object) Model. Controller, Dao layer,Model layer, Service layer was enabled to provide an Application Programming interface(API) to the react application.
